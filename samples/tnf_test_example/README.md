This example deploys a pod to be used with the CNF Test Suite provided by [test-network-function](https://github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function).

The image of this pod, obtained from [this repository](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test-partner/blob/main/local-test-infra/local-pod-under-test.yaml), is a suitable one for passing the "generic", "diagnostic" and "container" tests from the CNF Test Suite.
